# Aspire Shop

![Screenshot of the web front end the .NET Aspire Shop sample](./images/aspireshop-frontend-complete.png)

The app consists of four services:

- **AspireShop.Frontend**: This is a Blazor app that displays a paginated catlog of products and allows users to add products to a shopping cart.
- **AspireShop.CatalogService**: This is an HTTP API that provides access to the catalog of products stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- **AspireShop.CatalogDbManager**: This is an HTTP API that manages the initialization and updating of the catalog database.
- **AspireShop.BasketService**: This is a gRPC service that provides access to the shopping cart stored in Redis.

The app also includes a class library project, **AspireShop.ServiceDefaults**, that contains the service defaults used by the service projects.
